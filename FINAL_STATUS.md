# MPI Implementation - Final Status

## ‚úÖ Major Achievement

**Serial vs MPI-1: BITWISE IDENTICAL (0.000e+00 difference)**

This was achieved by ensuring `pas_HLL` operates on arrays of the same size as serial:
- Serial: passes 20x20 array to pas_HLL
- MPI-1: passes 20x20 interior (no halos) to pas_HLL
- Result: Identical behavior

## ‚ùå Remaining Issue

**MPI ranks produce different results** (0.384-0.741 difference)

### Root Cause

When passing only interior cells to `pas_HLL`, processor boundaries get physical BCs instead of using neighbor data from halos. The `pas_HLL` stencil needs M(j+1) and vpmin(j+1), which are in halos for processor boundaries.

### The Challenge

To include halos in arrays passed to `pas_HLL`, we need:
1. M in halos: ‚úì Available via halo_exchange_2d
2. Fx/Fy in halos: ‚úì Available via halo_exchange_2d  
3. Wave speeds in halos: ‚úó NOT computed (only computed for interior nx x ny)

## üîß Solution Path

**Compute wave speeds in halo cells after M halo exchange:**

```matlab
% After M halo exchange
M = halo_exchange_2d(M, decomp, bc);

% NEW: Compute wave speeds in halos
for i = 1:halo
    % Left halo
    MOM = squeeze(M(i, halo+1:halo+ny, :));
    [eigenvalues...] = compute_wave_speeds(MOM);
    % Store in extended wave speed array
end
% Similar for right, top, bottom halos

% Then pass M with halos to pas_HLL
% It will have correct wave speeds for stencil operations
```

## üìä Current Test Results

| Test | Difference | Status |
|------|-----------|--------|
| Serial vs MPI-1 | 0.000e+00 | ‚úÖ PERFECT |
| MPI-1 vs MPI-2 | 0.384 | ‚ùå |
| MPI-1 vs MPI-4 | 0.741 | ‚ùå |

## üéØ Next Step

Implement wave speed computation in halos, then MPI will be fully consistent.
