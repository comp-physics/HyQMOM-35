# MPI Implementation - Current Status & Path Forward

## 🎯 Achievement
**✅ Serial vs MPI-1: BITWISE IDENTICAL (0.000e+00)**

This is a major milestone - proves the approach is fundamentally sound.

## ❌ Current Issue  
MPI ranks (2, 4) differ from serial/MPI-1 by 0.047-0.796

## 📊 History of Attempts

### Attempt 1: Pass interior-only to pas_HLL ✅→❌
- **Result:** Serial = MPI-1 (perfect!)
- **Problem:** MPI ranks differ (processor boundaries get physical BCs)
- **Error:** ~0.047

### Attempt 2-4: Halo exchange + wave speed computation ❌
- Computed Fx/Fy/wave speeds in halos
- Added BC flags to pas_HLL
- **Problem:** Still 0.047 error
- **Root cause:** pas_HLL with full halos still had issues

### Attempt 5: Manual boundary flux computation ❌❌
- Tried to manually compute and inject correct fluxes
- **Result:** ERROR INCREASED to 0.796!
- **Root cause:** Completely wrong approach

## 💡 Key Insight

From ANALYSIS.md:

```
Serial cell 12 sees: M(11), M(12), M(13)
MPI Rank 0 cell 12 (last interior) sees: M(11), M(12), BC(M11)

The problem: Cell 13 exists on Rank 1, but pas_HLL doesn't see it!
```

## 🔧 Correct Solution

**Pass interior + exactly ONE halo cell per boundary:**

```matlab
% For left processor boundary:
% Pass M(halo:halo+nx) = [left_halo, interior_1:nx]
% Tell pas_HLL: apply_bc_left=false, apply_bc_right=true

% For right processor boundary:
% Pass M(halo+1:halo+nx+1) = [interior_1:nx, right_halo]
% Tell pas_HLL: apply_bc_left=true, apply_bc_right=false

% For both processor boundaries:
% Pass M(halo:halo+nx+1) = [left_halo, interior_1:nx, right_halo]
% Tell pas_HLL: apply_bc_left=false, apply_bc_right=false
```

This ensures:
1. pas_HLL sees neighbor data at processor boundaries
2. pas_HLL applies BCs only at physical boundaries  
3. Array size matches what pas_HLL expects
4. No manual flux computation needed

## 📁 Current Files
- `main_mpi.m`: Has manual boundary code (to be replaced)
- `src/pas_HLL.m`: Has BC flags (keep these!)
- `src/compute_boundary_flux_hll.m`: Can delete
- `ANALYSIS.md`, `MPI_DEBUGGING_STATUS.md`: Documentation

## 🚀 Next Step
Implement conditional array slicing based on processor boundaries.
