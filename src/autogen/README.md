# Auto-Generated Functions

This directory contains functions that were automatically generated by MATLAB's Symbolic Math Toolbox. These files should not be manually edited as they will be regenerated if the symbolic expressions are modified.

**Total: 1,189 lines of auto-generated code**

## Usage:
These functions are automatically called by the main simulation code. MATLAB will find them in this subdirectory since it's in the path.
